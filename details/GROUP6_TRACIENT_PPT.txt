Block Chain Based Income Traceabilty
System for Equitable Welfare
Distribution
Our Vision: To revolutionize welfare distribution in India by establishing a
robust, transparent, and accurate income assessment system for daily
wage and informal sector workers.
Core Innovation: Leveraging the inherent security and immutability of
Blockchain technology for verifiable income records, complemented by
AI/ML for intelligent analysis.
Driving Force: Addressing the critical societal challenge of misallocated
welfare resources and ensuring benefits reach the truly deserving, fostering
social and economic equity.

ABSTRACT
India’s informal sector struggles with inequitable welfare and unreliable
income assessments due to fragmented methods like government surveys
and banking data, resulting in false tax avoidance, inflated welfare claims,
and social inequities.
Our solution uses a private blockchain to create a verifiable digital wage
history, providing a solid foundation for accurate income data.
AI/ML models improve this by estimating income, determining dynamic
welfare eligibility (BPL/APL) and offering real-time insights via a
privacy-preserving dashboard for policymakers.
Compared to traditional methods, our system enhances accuracy,
adaptability, and fairness in welfare delivery.
Accurate income traceability ensures proper income tax calculation for
individuals, promoting fairness and accountability across the entire
workforce, not just the formal sector.
