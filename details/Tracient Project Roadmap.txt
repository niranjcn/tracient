Project Roadmap: Blockchain and AI-Enabled Income Traceability System (TRACIENT)
💡 Phase 0: Knowledge Prerequisites (Pre-Build)
Core Concepts to Learn
Concept Why It’s Important
Blockchain Basics Understand blocks, consensus, public/private chain, immutability
Hyperledger Fabric Framework for private blockchain, suited for gov/enterprise use
Go (Golang) Primary language for writing smart contracts (chaincode) in Fabric
Chaincode Logic How smart contracts enforce wage logging, BPL classification, etc.
AI/ML Models Needed for income prediction, classification (BPL/APL), fraud detection
Data Privacy + ZKP Ensure secure, non-leaky architecture for sensitive IDs like Aadhaar
🚀 Phase 1: Foundation & Proof of Concept (Months 1-3)
Goals:
Set up initial Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network
Write basic Go chaincode to log wage data
Build a working frontend + backend demo (PoC)
Key Tasks:
Team Setup
Roles: Blockchain Developer (Go), AI/ML Engineer , Frontend Developer , Backend Developer
Tools: GitHub, Docker , VS Code, Go 1.20+, Python 3.9+, Fabric binaries
Dev Environment Setup
Folder structure: blockchain/ , ai-model/ , backend/ , frontend/
Docker setup for Fabric
Architecture Design
Finalize system flow: Wage -> Chaincode -> AI -> Dashboard•

Define schemas: workerID , txnID, amount , employerID , sector , etc.
Fabric PoC Network
One-org setup via Docker Compose
Go chaincode: 
funcrecordWage (workerID string,employerID string,amount float64 ,
timestamp string)
funcqueryWageHistory (workerID string)
Simple API + Frontend
Node.js/Go backend to call chaincode
React UI: form to log wage, wage history viewer
⚙️ Phase 2: MVP Development (Months 4-7)
Goals:
Full blockchain + AI-backed MVP
Support for multi-org, user roles, dashboards
Key Tasks:
Multi-org Fabric Network
Setup orgs: Government, Employers, NGOs
Add identity management (CA, certificates)
Advanced Chaincode in Go
Access control: Only authorized employers log wages
New functions: 
funcupdateBPLStatus (workerID string,isBPLbool)
Merkle proof for verification9.

AI/ML Model Integration
Simulated wage dataset
ML Models:
Linear Regression (income estimation)
Random Forest (BPL classification)
Isolation Forest (anomaly detection)
Backend API Layer
Trigger ML models on new wage entries
Chaincode call to update eligibility flag
UI Panels
Employer Panel
Worker Panel (view income, history)
Government Dashboard
🔎 Phase 3: Integration & Security (Months 8-10)
Goals:
Finalize data flow, integrate real-world systems, and secure entire system
Key Tasks:
Integration
Simulated APIs: Aadhaar eKYC, UPI sandbox, Exotel/Twilio (IVR/SMS)
Testing
Unit: Chaincode + API
Integration: End-to-end from wage entry → dashboard
Performance: 10k txns stress test

Anonymize Aadhaar/PAN using SHA256
Add Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
Implement RBAC, encryption (TLS), penetration testing
🏠 Phase 4: Pilot Deployment (Month 11-12)
Goals:
Launch system for live users in limited area
Key Tasks:
Pilot Site Selection
1 Panchayat, construction group, or small NGO
Onboard 50–100 workers + employers
Cloud Deployment
AWS/GCP: Kubernetes for Fabric
Firebase/PostgreSQL/IPFS for storage
Feedback Loop
Conduct user interviews
Log system metrics, AI accuracy, UI UX issues
📊 Phase 5: Scaling & Expansion (Post Pilot)
Goals:
Scale to state or national level
Get policy and government adoption
Key Tasks:
System Enhancement
Retrain AI models on live data8.
