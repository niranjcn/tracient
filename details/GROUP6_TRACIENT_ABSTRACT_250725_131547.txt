Blockchain and AI-Enabled Income Traceability
System for Equitable Welfare Distribution
Abstract
Ensuring equitable welfare distribution and accurate income assessment for daily wage
and informal sector workers in India remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods
such as income tax filings, government surveys like the Periodic Labour Force Survey
(PLFS) and the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), ration card declarations, and
banking data are either infrequent, fragmented, or exclude the vast informal workforce,
which constitutes over 80% of India’s labor population. This results in unreliable, eas-
ily manipulated, or self-declared income records. Consequently, many individuals falsely
claim Below Poverty Line (BPL) status, inflating the BPL population and causing misal-
location of welfare resources. This deprives genuinely deserving populations of adequate
benefits, contributing to social and economic inequities. To address these challenges,
we propose an Income Traceability System powered by blockchain and AI/ML technolo-
gies. The system immutably records every digital wage payment on a private blockchain,
creating a tamper-proof, verifiable income history. AI models accurately estimate in-
come bands, dynamically classify individuals for welfare eligibility such as BPL or Above
Poverty Line (APL). Additionally, the system offers a government-ready, real-time mon-
itoring dashboard for policymakers, ensuring privacy-preserving data handling, context-
aware income profiling, and automated welfare eligibility flagging. Compared to tradi-
tional methods, this system offers greater accuracy, real-time insights, and adaptability
to the fluctuating nature of informal sector incomes. By integrating blockchain-verified
wage records with AI-driven analytics, the framework enhances the fairness, integrity,
and efficiency of welfare delivery, ensuring benefits reach the truly deserving. Combined
with strong governmental reforms promoting digital and cashless transactions, the system
can also help curb illegal activities like money laundering, tax evasion and unaccounted
financial flows, contributing to a more transparent, inclusive, and economically resilient
society.
EXPECTED INPUT: (All inputs are simulated due to security reasons)
•PAN / Aadhaar Number — Unique identifier for each worker (optionally anonymized
for privacy)
•Wage Payment Data — Amount paid, date/time, transaction ID, and payment
mode (UPI, bank transfer)
•Job Type / Sector — Nature of employment (e.g., construction, housekeeping)
to contextualize income
•Government Threshold Data — Income ceilings for BPL/APL classification as
defined by policy
•Policy Parameters — Specific eligibility rules for welfare schemes (e.g., income
cutoffs, sector priorities)
•Banking/UPI APIs — Interfaces to fetch and verify digital payment records
EXPECTED OUTPUT:
•Immutable Wage Record — Tamper-proof transaction history recorded on blockchain
•Estimated Annual Income — AI-predicted total yearly income for each worker
•Dynamic BPL/APL Classification — Real-time classification based on updated
income data
•Welfare Eligibility Flags — Automated indicators of eligibility for welfare schemes
•Policy Monitoring Dashboard — Visual tool for authorities to monitor income
trends and eligibility distributions
