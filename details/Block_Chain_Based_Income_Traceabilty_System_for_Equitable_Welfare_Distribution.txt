Abstract
Ensuring equitable welfare distribution and accurate income assessment for daily wage
and informal sector workers in India remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods
such as income tax filings, government surveys like the Periodic Labour Force Survey
(PLFS) and the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC), ration card declarations, and
banking data are either infrequent, fragmented, or exclude the vast informal workforce,
which constitutes over 80ily manipulated, or self-declared income records. Consequently,
many individuals falsely claim Below Poverty Line (BPL) status, inflating the BPL
population and causing misal- location of welfare resources. This deprives genuinely de-
serving populations of adequate benefits, contributing to social and economic inequities.
To address these challenges, we propose an Income Traceability System powered by
blockchain and AI/ML technolo- gies. The system immutably records every digital wage
payment on a private blockchain, creating a tamper-proof, verifiable income history.
AI models accurately estimate in- come bands, dynamically classify individuals for
welfare eligibility such as BPL or Above Poverty Line (APL). Additionally, the system
offers a government-ready, real-time mon- itoring dashboard for policymakers, ensuring
privacy-preserving data handling, context- aware income profiling, and automated welfare
eligibility flagging. Compared to tradi- tional methods, this system offers greater
accuracy, real-time insights, and adaptability to the fluctuating nature of informal sector
incomes. By integrating blockchain-verified wage records with AI-driven analytics,
the framework enhances the fairness, integrity, and efficiency of welfare delivery,
ensuring benefits reach the truly deserving. Combined with strong governmental reforms
promoting digital and cashless transactions, the system can also help curb illegal activities
like money laundering, tax evasion and unaccounted financial flows, contributing to a
more transparent, inclusive, and economically resilient society.

Introduction
In India, many welfare schemes have been implemented to aid and uplift different sections
of society who are financially incapable of becoming empowered on their own. While
these schemes provide incentives based on the current financial status of citizens through
classifications such as APL and BPL, the eligibility criteria mainly depend on their income
pattern throughout a financial year or their annual income. The methods employed for
gathering this income data, such as manual surveys, have often been found to produce
inaccurate and inconsistent records. The failure to devise appropriate strategies that could
overcome the shortcomings of the existing approaches in an effective and economical
manner has been the root cause of the continued use of these outdated methods even in
the current scenario.
While existing systems can accurately record the annual income of formal sector
workers, the lack of means to verify the credibility of self-proclaimed incomes of
informal sector workers has resulted in major inaccuracies. Moreover, many citizens
who are aware of the potential benefits of the incentivized categories and the liabilities
of the category they truly belong to may provide false information to enjoy undeserved
benefits. When examining actual census records of annual income, the statistics for
such misclassification are alarmingly high. The consequences include financially weaker
sections being deprived of their rightful incentives, undeserving individuals receiving tax
exemptions, and reduced opportunities for the government to design better and more
targeted welfare schemes for the truly deserving population.
We have identified the need for an approach that integrates blockchain technology to
record financial transactions made throughout the year in combination with the Unified
1
Payments Interface (UPI). This can create an immutable and traceable storage system
that can be used for accurate income data collection. Through this paper, we present our
proposed system, which aims to address these challenges while effectively eliminating the
need for tedious tasks such as manual data collection through traditional census methods
and facilitating an equitable welfare distribution.
1.1 Motivation
The methods currently in practice for annual income data collection for both informal and
formal sectors of workers have been found to be insufficient and inaccurate. While the
credibility of records can be ensured to a certain degree for income data from the formal
sector, the same cannot be said for the informal sector, where a large portion of the data
is self-proclaimed. This leaves room for both unintentional and intentional inaccuracies.
Moreover, the data being stored in centralized systems makes it vulnerable to tampering.
The direct consequences of these inaccuracies are reflected in the welfare policies
introduced by the government to aid financially backward sections. Undeserving
individuals who are misclassified into these categories increase the overall count of
beneficiaries, thereby reducing the share of funds available to each deserving person.
Furthermore, a significant portion of the funds allocated for genuine welfare schemes is
misused in this way. Such misclassified individuals are also exempted from taxes, leading
to a reduction in government tax revenue, which in turn forces the government to increase
the tax burden on genuine taxpayers.
As elaborated above, these inaccuracies stunt the economy’s growth and, conse-
quently, the development of the country as well as the standard of living of its citizens.
Realizing these issues encouraged us to explore a blockchain-based, AI-integrated
approach to address the shortcomings of the current system. Blockchain, when used to
record wage transactions, ensures immutability and traceability, while AI can be used to
estimate income patterns of individuals throughout the year. This enables accurate annual
income calculation even for workers in the informal sector.
By implementing this pilot project, we aim to explore its potential for adaptation and
integration into the economy. With proper governmental policies and UPI integration, we
can achieve a more equitable welfare system and a much more transparent economy.

1.2 Problem definition
Determination of eligibility for welfare schemes and other governmental benefits, as
well as the imposition of various taxes in India, follows the classification of citizens
into different categories based on their annual income. The current methods in practice
for obtaining annual income data, such as manual census, have been found to produce
inaccurate results. This inaccuracy is highly significant in the informal sector, where no
verifiable wage records exist and data collection is heavily reliant on self-declarations.
As a result, individuals may exploit loopholes in the system to get falsely classified as
beneficiaries.
The issue this generates is the large-scale misallocation of welfare funds to unde-
serving individuals, while those truly in need are left with minimal aid owing to the
inflated beneficiary population. Such individuals are also exempted from their liabilities,
such as income taxes, further reducing the government’s revenue that could be channeled
into additional welfare schemes and developmental strategies. This not only prevents
economically backward classes from improving their circumstances but also negatively
impacts the overall economic and social standards of the country.
Another issue we address here is that the centralized storage of personal annual
income data is vulnerable to tampering, and the lack of transparency and traceability
further makes the current system inadequate. We devised a blockchain-based, AI-
integrated pilot project named Tracient to solve these identified issues and verify its
performance in a simulated environment when integrated with the UPI system of India.

Literature Review
A literature survey is an essential component of any research or project work that involves
studying and analyzing existing research papers, publications, and related systems in the
chosen domain. It provides an overview of the progress made in the field, highlights
existing challenges, and helps in identifying the research gaps that the current project
aims to address. By reviewing previous works, researchers gain valuable insights into the
methodologies, technologies, and design strategies adopted by others, allowing them to
build upon proven concepts while avoiding known limitations.
The literature survey also establishes the theoretical foundation and credibility of the
project. It ensures that the proposed system is not developed in isolation but rather extends
and improves upon existing knowledge. Through a proper review, one can evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of prior approaches, understand the feasibility of integrating
specific technologies, and identify opportunities for innovation within the selected field.
Although we were unable to find any previous implementations directly addressing
income traceability and welfare distribution using blockchain, the literature papers we
referred to during our survey offered essential insights that guided the development of our
proposed system.
The paper “Blockchain-Based KYC and Access Verification for Financial Insti-
tutions” provided valuable understanding of improving data security and ensuring
privacy through decentralized identity verification. The work “Blockchain-Integrated
Digital Payment Systems in the Public Sector: Innovation, Transparency, and Economic
Efficiency in Emerging Markets” offered clarity on the perks and challenges of integrating
blockchain technology with India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), highlighting both
4
its feasibility and potential societal benefits. Similarly, the paper “On the Integration
of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology: A Perspective About Security”
provided guidance on the challenges and best practices for properly integrating AI
mechanisms with blockchain frameworks to enhance decision-making and data reliability.
Additionally, our base paper, “An Explainable Federated Blockchain Framework
with Privacy-Preserving AI Optimization for Securing Healthcare Data,” significantly
influenced the technical direction of our project. This work demonstrates an effective
integration of blockchain and AI within a federated learning environment to ensure
data privacy, transparency, and model optimization. Many of the core principles
and architectural concepts presented in this study, such as decentralized validation,
explainable AI, and privacy-preserving mechanisms, form the foundation for several
technical aspects implemented in our system as well.
Together, these studies provided the conceptual and technical groundwork necessary
to design our blockchain-based, AI-integrated income traceability system, ensuring it is
secure, transparent, scalable, and adaptable for equitable welfare distribution.
2.1 Blockchain-Integrated Digital Payment Systems in
the Public Sector: Innovation, Transparency, and
Economic Efficiency in Emerging Markets
The 2025 paper by Vani Tyagi and Dr. Yogita Beri, titled ”Blockchain-Integrated
Digital Payment Systems in the Public Sector: Innovation, Transparency, and Economic
Efficiency in Emerging Markets,” offers a detailed look at how blockchain can improve
government-backed payment systems in places like India. It doesn’t just talk about theory;
it uses India’s Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, as a real-world example to build its
case. The main issue the paper tackles is that even with successful systems like UPI,
public finance still struggles with things like corruption, a lack of full transparency, and
high costs for certain transactions. The authors suggest that instead of replacing UPI, we
should enhance it. Their proposed solution is a hybrid model. In this setup, the super-
fast and scalable UPI system would keep handling all the everyday, small-value payments
we make. At the same time, a new blockchain layer would be added to handle specific,
high-stakes transactions, like government subsidy payments or large public procurement
5
contracts, where having a secure and unchangeable record is most important.
To show why this is a good idea, the paper spends a lot of time on the success of UPI.
It details its massive growth from its launch in 2016 to becoming a system that processes
billions of transactions every month across hundreds of banks. This part of the analysis
is important because it proves that a large-scale, government-led digital finance project
can actually work. To illustrate this, our report should include Figure 2 and Figure 3
from their paper, which show the growth in UPI’s transaction volume and the number of
participating banks. The paper also brings in user survey data showing that even though
people use UPI a lot, a good number of them are still worried about security and whether
the system can be tampered with. This is where the authors argue that blockchain’s core
feature of creating a permanent, tamper-proof ledger can help build more trust.
Figure 2.1: SWOT Analysis:Challenges in a Hybrid System
The most useful part of the paper for understanding the whole picture is its SWOT
analysis of this proposed hybrid system. It gives a really balanced view of the pros and
cons. The strengths are pretty clear: you get better transparency and accountability from
blockchain, while keeping the speed and low cost of UPI for normal payments. The
weaknesses are also significant, mainly the technical difficulty of connecting a centralized
system with a decentralized one, the lack of clear regulations for blockchain, and the high
6
initial cost to build it. The opportunities are exciting, like improving financial inclusion
for people in rural areas and using smart contracts to automate payments. Finally, the
threats are what you might expect, such as cybersecurity risks and the challenge of getting
people and institutions to adopt a new way of doing things.
The paper is significant because it shifts the discussion about blockchain from a ”what
if” scenario to a more practical ”how to” guide. By suggesting we integrate blockchain
with a system that already works, instead of trying to replace it, the authors present a
much more believable path forward. The idea feels grounded and achievable because
it’s built on the proven success of UPI. The paper also looks at what other countries like
Singapore and Estonia have done, which adds a global perspective and offers lessons on
what works. In terms of practicality, the paper is very realistic. It acknowledges that
just flipping a switch to a blockchain-based system is not going to happen overnight. It
even points to Figure 1 from its research, which shows that globally, blockchain adoption
is still very low, with a majority of companies having not even considered it. Because
of this, the paper’s recommendation for a phased approach is very practical. It suggests
starting with small pilot projects in a controlled environment, often called a ”regulatory
sandbox.” This would let the government test the technology on a smaller scale, like for a
specific welfare scheme, to see how it performs and fix any issues before thinking about
a nationwide rollout.
Relevance
•Validates Your Problem Statement:The paper’s core argument—that public finance
systems in emerging markets need enhanced transparency and efficiency to reduce
corruption and better serve citizens—directly aligns with your project’s mission to
create an ”equitable welfare distribution” system. It provides a strong academic
backing for why a system like TRACIENT is necessary.
•Supports Your Hybrid Architecture: Your project architecture, which includes an
Integration Subsystem to connect with UPI and Aadhaar, is a practical imple-
mentation of the hybrid model this paper advocates for. The paper explains why
this hybrid approach is superior to a pure blockchain solution, giving you a solid
rationale for your design choice. You can argue that TRACIENT is not trying to
replace UPI but is instead providing a specialized, secure ledger for a specific public
7
finance function (income traceability), which can then leverage UPI for the actual
payment disbursal.
•Highlights the Challenges You Will Face: The SWOT analysis in the paper
essentially provides a pre-made risk assessment for your project. The weaknesses
and threats it identifies—technical integration challenges, regulatory hurdles, public
awareness, and scalability issues—are precisely the challenges your TRACIENT
system will encounter. You can use this section of the paper to build out the
”Challenges and Limitations” chapter of your own report and discuss how your
project plans to mitigate these risks.
•The paper’s policy recommendations offer a plausible adoption pathway for
TRACIENT. You can position your project not as a final, nationwide solution but
as a proposed pilot project that aligns with the paper’s recommendation. This
makes your proposal seem more practical and grounded, suggesting it could be
tested within a single district or for a specific welfare scheme first, allowing the
government to gather data and assess its effectiveness in a controlled manner before
scaling up.
2.2 Blockchain-Based KYC and Access Verification for
Financial Institutions
The paper ”Blockchain-Based KYC and Access Verification for Financial Institutions” by
Beauden John, set for June 2025, looks at a common but frustrating problem in banking:
the Know Your Customer, or KYC, process. The author points out that the traditional way
of doing KYC is slow, expensive, and annoying for customers because they have to repeat
the same verification process for every new financial service they use. More importantly,
it’s not very secure. Banks store tons of sensitive personal data in centralized databases,
which makes them a prime target for hackers, and data breaches are a huge risk. The
solution proposed in the paper is to build a KYC system on a blockchain. The idea is to
create a shared, decentralized ledger that all participating financial institutions can trust.
The proposed system is designed as a permissioned blockchain, meaning only
authorized banks and financial entities can join and validate information. Customer
8
identities would be stored securely on this network, and smart contracts would be used
to automate the whole verification process. A key part of the design is how it handles
data storage. Instead of putting bulky, sensitive documents like ID scans directly on
the blockchain, which is inefficient and risky for privacy, the system stores them in a
secure off-chain location. Only a cryptographic hash, which is like a unique digital
fingerprint of the document, is recorded on the blockchain. This way, you get the security
and immutability of the blockchain to prove the document’s integrity without actually
exposing the personal data on the ledger. The framework also uses something called
Decentralized Identifiers, which allows customers to have control over their own digital
identity and decide which pieces of information to share with which institution. The
significance of this research lies in its potential to completely reshape how identity is
managed in the financial world. It offers a solution to a problem that costs the industry
billions of dollars and is a major source of friction for customers. By creating a single,
verifiable, and user-controlled identity, it could eliminate the need for repetitive KYC
checks, speed up customer onboarding, and significantly reduce administrative costs for
banks. This would make the entire financial ecosystem more efficient and secure. It
represents a shift from a system where institutions own and control customer data to one
where customers have more sovereignty over their own information, which is a big deal
for privacy.
In terms of practicality, the paper is quite realistic and highlights some major hurdles.
The biggest challenge is interoperability. For a shared KYC system to work, all the
different banks, with their different legacy IT systems, would need to agree on a common
standard, which is a massive coordination problem. Another practical issue is the
regulatory uncertainty. Laws around data privacy, like GDPR in Europe, have strict
rules, including the ”right to be forgotten,” which directly conflicts with the immutable,
permanent nature of blockchain. It’s still unclear how a blockchain-based identity would
be treated legally. The paper also acknowledges that blockchain technology itself can
have performance limitations, like low transaction speeds, which could be a problem for
a system that needs to handle real-time verifications at a large scale.
Relevance
This paper is highly relevant to our TRACIENT project for several key reasons. First,
the core of TRACIENT is about creating a trusted and verifiable record for an individual,
in our case, a worker’s income history. The KYC paper provides a solid framework for the
9
identity management part of our system. We can adopt its model of using a permissioned
blockchain and Decentralized Identifiers to securely register and manage the identities of
workers, employers, and government authorities in our system.
Second, the paper’s approach to data privacy and storage is directly applicable to
TRACIENT. We will be handling sensitive financial data about workers’ wages. The
hybrid on-chain and off-chain storage model is a perfect solution for us. We can
store the unchangeable proof of a wage transaction on the blockchain, like the amount,
date, and hashes of the employer’s and worker’s identities, while keeping the detailed,
personally identifiable information in a secure off-chain database. This would give us the
transparency and auditability we need without compromising worker privacy.
Finally, the KYC paper’s discussion on using smart contracts for access control is
a great blueprint for our policy dashboard. TRACIENT needs to ensure that workers
can only see their own data, employers can only manage their own wage payments, and
government officials can only access aggregated, anonymized data for policymaking. We
can use smart contracts to automatically enforce these access rules, creating a system
that is transparent and secure by design. The challenges it outlines, especially around
regulation and user adoption, are also the same ones we will face, which helps us
anticipate and plan for them in our own project.
2.3 On the Integration of Artificial Intelligence and
Blockchain Technology: A Perspective About Secu-
rity
On the Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology: A Perspective
About Security offers a focused literature review on the convergence of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT), highlighting how their integration
can strengthen security and trust in digital systems.
1.Principles of Integration: Decentralized AI
The research addresses security challenges inherent in conventional computing
systems. While AI relies on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
processes, BCT offers a decentralized, immutable ledger for transaction records.
10
Centralized AI models are identified as vulnerable to hacking and manipulation,
as all data is concentrated in a single location. The integration of AI and
BCT establishes a decentralized AI model, which leverages blockchain to enable
processing and decision-making based on trusted, digitally signed, and secure
shared data, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. This decentralized approach facilitates
collective decision-making, with outcomes verified by network nodes to ensure
traceability and integrity.
Figure 2.2: Blockchain and AI: centralized and decentralized AI
2.Benefits of Integration
Integrating BCT and AI generates several advantages with direct applicability to
secure system design:
•Enhanced Data Security and Trust:The decentralized and immutable
nature of blockchain ensures that AI algorithms operate on credible, verified
data.
•Transparency and Explainability:Storing AI decisions on the blockchain
produces a secure, transparent record, addressing the ”black box” issue often
associated with deep learning models.
•Efficiency and Scalability:AI can optimize blockchain network operations
by enhancing consensus mechanisms and accelerating validation, mitigating
11
scalability challenges.
•Model Security:Blockchain-based Model Version Control allows every
iteration of an AI model to be immutably recorded, maintaining a transparent
history of model development.
3.Integrated Security Challenges and Mitigation
Despite the benefits, combined AI-blockchain systems are subject to security
challenges inherent to both technologies (Figure 2.3). The vulnerabilities and
associated mitigation strategies are summarized as follows:
Figure 2.3: Existing security issues associated with Blockchain and AI
•Artificial Intelligence Security Issues:AI systems may face adversarial
attacks that manipulate input data, bias in decision-making due to training
datasets, and privacy concerns. Mitigation strategies include robust model de-
sign, privacy-preserving techniques such as federated learning or differential
privacy, and transparent AI models to detect and correct biases (Table 2.1).
•Blockchain Technology Security Issues:Despite its decentralized architec-
ture, blockchain remains susceptible to 51% attacks, smart contract vulner-
abilities, and private key management risks. Mitigation strategies include

2.4 An explainable federated blockchain framework
with privacy-preserving AI optimization for securing
healthcare data
The base paper for our project is ”An explainable federated blockchain framework
with privacy-preserving AI optimization for securing healthcare data” by Tanisha
Bhardwaj and K. Sumangali. This paper introduces a really advanced framework
they call PPFBXAIO, which stands for Privacy Preserving Federated Blockchain
Explainable Artificial Intelligence Optimization. The core problem it tries to solve
is a big one in healthcare: how to use machine learning to analyze sensitive patient
14
Figure 2.4: A FL Framework
data from different hospitals without actually moving or centralizing that data, all
while making sure the process is secure, private, and easy to understand for doctors.
Their solution is pretty complex and brings together a few different technologies.
First, they use Federated Learning, which is a way to train a shared AI model across
multiple locations without the raw data ever leaving the original hospital’s server.
This is great for privacy.
Second, they use a blockchain to create a secure, tamper-proof log of all the model
updates. This means every change to the shared AI model is recorded permanently,
which adds a layer of trust and auditability. They also use smart contracts to
automatically validate the quality of these updates before they are accepted.
The third component is Explainable AI, or XAI. A common problem with complex
AI models is that they are like a ”black box”—they give you an answer, but you
don’t know how they got it. In medicine, that’s a huge issue because doctors need
to trust and understand the AI’s reasoning. The PPFBXAIO framework uses XAI
tools like SHAP to make the model’s predictions interpretable.
15
Figure 2.5: Workflow of Proposed Framework for PPFBXAIO
Finally, they use an optimization algorithm called the Levy Grasshopper Opti-
mization Algorithm, or LGOA, to automatically select the most important features
from the data, which helps make the AI model more accurate and efficient. They
tested their framework using two well-known medical datasets, the Heart Disease
dataset and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, and their results showed very high
accuracy and better performance compared to other standard federated learning
methods.
The significance of this paper is that it provides a complete, end-to-end architecture
for building trustworthy AI in a high-stakes field like healthcare. It’s not just about
making the AI accurate; it’s about making it secure, private, and explainable all at
the same time. This holistic approach is what makes it a strong foundation for our
own work. It shows that it’s possible to design a system that respects data privacy
while still allowing for collaborative machine learning.
From a practical standpoint, the paper is ambitious. Integrating all these different
technologies is technically very challenging. The authors themselves point out in
16
their study that adding blockchain and XAI increases the computational overhead,
meaning it requires more processing power and time compared to a simpler
federated learning setup. For example, running XAI calculations and validating
transactions on a blockchain adds latency to the system. The framework, as
presented, is also quite theoretical and tested in a simulated environment. Getting
multiple real-world hospitals to adopt and integrate such a complex system would
face enormous logistical and financial challenges. So, while it’s a very powerful
design, its real-world implementation would require a lot of resources and careful
planning.
Relevance
This paper is the direct inspiration for our TRACIENT system, and its relevance
is fundamental. We are essentially taking the core architectural concepts of the
PPFBXAIO framework and adapting them from the healthcare domain to the socio-
economic domain of public welfare. The way the base paper combines blockchain
for security and AI for intelligent analysis is the exact same principle we are using.
We can point to its success in securing sensitive medical data as a strong justification
for why a similar approach can work for securing sensitive income data.
More specifically, we are borrowing the idea of using a private blockchain to create
a tamper-proof audit trail. In their case, it’s for AI model updates; in our case, it’s
for wage transactions. This proves that blockchain is a solid choice for creating the
verifiable wage history that is central to TRACIENT. Also, their use of advanced
AI for classification and optimization inspires our own use of AI/ML models for
income estimation and eligibility classification. The LGOA algorithm they use for
feature selection is a powerful technique that we could consider for optimizing our
own models to ensure they are as accurate as possible.
However, our project also makes some important advancements. The base paper’s
framework is designed for a very specific, institutional use case and doesn’t
consider integration with large-scale public infrastructure. A major part of
TRACIENT’s novelty is its design to connect with real-world systems like Aadhaar
for identity verification and UPI for payments, making it much more practical for
a nationwide public service. Furthermore, their AI models are for static medical
diagnoses, whereas our AI models need to be dynamic and adaptive to handle the
17
constantly changing nature of income and employment in the informal sector. So,
we are not just copying their framework; we are evolving it to solve a different,
more dynamic problem in a public-facing context.

Proposed System
3.1 Proposed System Description
The proposed system, Tracient, is a Blockchain-Based Income Traceability System
for Equitable Welfare Distribution. It aims to revolutionize the welfare distribution
process in India by introducing transparency, accountability, and data-driven
accuracy in income assessment, especially among the informal and unorganized
workforce. The system bridges the credibility gap present in traditional data
collection methods and ensures equitable allocation of welfare benefits.
Tracient integrates the strengths of Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Ma-
chine Learning (ML) into a unified architecture. It creates a secure, decentralized
ecosystem where income records are immutable and verifiable, while AI-driven
analytics support intelligent policy decisions.
System Layers Overview
The proposed system is designed as a multi-layered architecture, each component
performing a distinct role in ensuring transparency, accuracy, and security. The
layers are as follows:
(a) Blockchain Layer – Handles immutable and transparent recording of verified
income transactions.
19
(b) AI/ML Layer – Performs intelligent analysis, income estimation, and dynamic
categorization.
(c) Dashboard and Decision Support Layer – Provides a real-time, visual interface
for policymakers to monitor, analyze, and take informed decisions.
Each of these layers interacts seamlessly to ensure that the system maintains trust,
fairness, and adaptability in income evaluation and welfare distribution.
3.1.1 Blockchain Layer
The blockchain layer serves as the foundation of trust in the proposed system. A
private blockchain network is implemented to record verifiable income transactions
for both formal and informal sector workers. Each transaction, whether it
involves wage payment, self-declared income, or verified employment data, is
hashed and stored in the blockchain ledger, ensuring immutability and traceability.
Smart contracts are used to automate validation processes such as verifying the
authenticity of wage submissions and ensuring compliance with government-
approved formats. By decentralizing record storage, the system prevents data
tampering and provides full auditability across all welfare-related financial records.
3.1.2 AI/ML Layer
The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning layer enhances the system’s
analytical capability by processing the income data recorded on the blockchain.
It estimates probable income for individuals based on employment patterns,
transaction trends, and historical data. The models dynamically classify citizens
into Below Poverty Line (BPL) or Above Poverty Line (APL) categories using
adaptive algorithms, and they also detect anomalies such as underreported or
exaggerated incomes. These intelligent processes ensure the credibility of income
assessments while maintaining data privacy and improving the overall accuracy,
adaptability, and fairness of welfare decision-making.
20
3.1.3 Dashboard and Decision Support Layer
The system incorporates a privacy-preserving administrative dashboard that pro-
vides real-time insights for policymakers and welfare officers. It visualizes
aggregated and anonymized information such as verified income histories, welfare
eligibility classifications, and regional or demographic income patterns. By offering
clear, data-driven visualizations and analytics, the dashboard assists policymakers
in identifying income disparities and optimizing the allocation of welfare resources.
This ensures that assistance reaches those who need it most, promoting a more
transparent and efficient welfare system.
3.1.4 Benefits and Key Advantages
The proposed system introduces several transformative benefits:
•Transparency: Every income record is permanently traceable through blockchain.
•Security: Immutable ledgers and cryptographic verification prevent manipu-
lation.
•Fairness: AI-based dynamic categorization ensures equitable welfare alloca-
tion.
•Accountability: Tamper-proof digital records promote honest income report-
ing.
•Scalability: The modular design allows integration with national systems like
Aadhaar and UPI in the future.
3.1.5 Comparative Advantage
Unlike traditional survey-based or centralized income data collection systems,
Tracient ensures accuracy, adaptability, and integrity. It overcomes the limitations
of static, self-reported data and provides a real-time, evolving view of the economic
landscape. By using blockchain as the record base and AI for analysis, the system
minimizes human bias, reduces operational inefficiency, and establishes a robust
digital framework for fair and accountable income verification.
21
3.1.6 Socio-Technical Impact
Beyond its technical framework, Tracient addresses a significant social challenge
by ensuring that welfare benefits reach the truly deserving sections of society. By
combining technological innovation with ethical governance principles, it promotes
data transparency, decentralization, and equity. The system has the potential to
transform welfare governance in developing economies, setting a global precedent
for blockchain-integrated public sector reforms that enhance both social justice and
administrative efficiency.
3.2 Requirement Analysis
Requirements analysis for the Tracient system was a crucial process for defining
its core functionalities and operational constraints. The goal was to understand and
specify what the system must do to create a robust, transparent, and accurate income
verification framework. This framework is intended to serve as a single source
of truth for determining citizen eligibility across a wide spectrum of government
services and benefits, including welfare schemes (BPL/APL classification), educa-
tional grants, and income-based reservations for examinations, thereby addressing
the limitations of existing fragmented methods. This analysis was divided into two
key areas: functional and non-functional requirements.
3.2.1 Functional Requirement
One of the key functional requirements was the ability to immutably record
every digital wage payment on a private blockchain, creating a tamper-proof and
verifiable income history. This necessitated the use of Hyperledger Fabric and the
development of smart contracts (chaincode) in Go with functions to record wages
(recordWage), query wage histories (queryWageHistory), and update eligibility
flags (updateBPLStatus). Another critical function was the integration of an AI/ML
engine to intelligently process this on-chain data. This required the AI to perform
several tasks: estimate a worker’s annual income from fragmented payment data
using models like Linear Regression , dynamically classify their eligibility status for
22
various schemes based on a flexible set of policy rules and income thresholds using
models like Random Forest , and detect anomalies that could indicate fraudulent
activity using Isolation Forest. Furthermore, the system needed to provide distinct
user interfaces: a simple interface for employers to submit wage payments, a portal
for workers to view their own income history and status, and a real-time policy
monitoring dashboard for government authorities to view aggregated analytics and
eligibility distributions.
3.2.2 Non Functional Requirement
The non-functional requirements were equally important to ensure the system’s
security, trustworthiness, and widespread adoption.Security and Privacy were
prioritized. The system must operate on a private, permissioned blockchain
to ensure only authorized entities like government bodies and employers can
participate. All sensitive data, such as PAN or Aadhaar numbers, must be
anonymized before being recorded on-chain, for instance, by using a secure hash
like SHA256. The architecture must be privacy-preserving, with provisions for
features like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to verify income status without
revealing the underlying data. Usability and Accessibility were also critical. To
cater to a user base with varying levels of digital literacy, the system must support
multiple modes of interaction, including simple web/mobile apps, as well as SMS
and IVR-based interfaces in regional languages. Scalability is essential for a system
with national-level ambition. The architecture must be designed to handle a high
volume of transactions and be deployable on cloud infrastructure using container
orchestration technologies like Docker and Kubernetes
3.2.3 Other Requirement
Hardware requirements
The hardware infrastructure for the Tracient system is primarily cloud-native,
meaning the production environment runs on platforms like AWS or Azure,
which provide the underlying physical servers as a managed service. This
23
involves utilizing virtualized resources such as scalable compute instances (VMs)
to host the blockchain nodes and backend services, managed Kubernetes for
container orchestration, and high-performance cloud storage for ledger data.
For the development phase, a local workstation with a multi-core processor, a
recommended 16 GB of RAM, and an SSD is necessary to efficiently run the entire
software stack within a Docker environment. The hardware requirements for end-
users are minimal, necessitating only a basic smartphone for the mobile application
or any standard phone for interaction via the planned SMS and IVR interfaces.
Software requirements
Go (Golang) is utilized as the primary programming language for developing the
on-chain business logic, specifically the smart contracts (chaincode) that run on
the Hyperledger Fabric network. These contracts manage the immutable recording
of wage data and the updating of eligibility statuses. Hyperledger Fabric itself is
the core blockchain framework, chosen for its private, permissioned nature which
is suitable for a government-collaborated system. Python, along with libraries
such as Scikit-learn, is used to develop the AI/ML models responsible for income
estimation, BPL/APL classification, and anomaly detection. A Node.js server
using the Express.js framework acts as the backend API layer, handling requests
from the frontend, interacting with the blockchain network, and invoking the AI
engine for analysis. The frontend dashboard and user interfaces are developed using
React. The entire multi-component architecture is containerized using Docker and
Docker Compose, which ensures consistency across development and production
environments and simplifies deployment. Finally, Git is used for version control
throughout the project lifecycle.
3.3 Feasibility Study
A feasibility study was conducted to rigorously evaluate the viability of the
Tracient system across four key dimensions: technical, operational, economic, and
performance. This analysis ensures that the proposed framework for a unified
income traceability system is not only conceptually sound but also practically
24
implementable, financially justifiable, and capable of meeting its performance
objectives.
3.3.1 Operational Feasibility
Operational feasibility evaluates how well the system can be integrated into
existing government workflows and adopted by its intended users. The system
is strategically designed to align with major national initiatives like Digital India,
eShram, and the India Stack (Aadhaar, UPI), ensuring it complements rather than
disrupts the existing digital infrastructure. A significant operational challenge is
the varying digital literacy among informal sector workers, which is addressed by
providing multiple user-friendly interfaces, including simple mobile apps, SMS-
based interactions, and IVR (Interactive V oice Response) systems in regional
languages. To further ease adoption, the rollout plan suggests partnering with
Common Service Centres (CSCs) and NGOs to assist workers with onboarding
and training. By replacing the repetitive, manual submission of income proofs with
a single verifiable digital record, the system streamlines the current bureaucratic
process for both citizens and officials, with a phased pilot deployment ensuring that
any operational issues are resolved before a national-scale rollout.
3.3.2 Economic Feasibility
Economic feasibility focuses on the financial viability of the project by weighing the
initial and ongoing costs against the substantial long-term benefits. The initial costs
are associated with the development effort and setting up the cloud infrastructure,
while ongoing costs would involve the maintenance and scaling of these cloud
resources based on user and transaction volume. However, the economic benefits
are extensive and transformative; the primary return on investment comes from the
significant reduction in financial leakage caused by fraudulent claims for welfare
schemes, educational grants, income-based reservations, and other subsidies. By
providing an accurate and tamper-proof income history, the system ensures that
benefits are targeted precisely to the deserving population. Additionally, it can
improve tax compliance within the informal sector and help curb unaccounted
25
financial flows, contributing to a more transparent economy. The long-term savings
from reduced fraud and increased efficiency are projected to far outweigh the
project’s costs, making it a highly valuable investment.
3.3.3 Performance Feasibility
Performance feasibility assesses the system’s ability to meet its objectives for
accuracy, speed, and scalability, which are critical for its real-world application.
The core value of the system depends on the accuracy of its AI models in
estimating annual income and classifying eligibility, as inaccurate predictions
would undermine the system’s purpose of fair distribution. The performance of
the blockchain itself is also crucial; the system must handle a high volume of wage
transactions quickly, a requirement that Hyperledger Fabric is designed to meet with
its capacity for higher throughput compared to public blockchains. Finally, the end-
to-end system must exhibit low latency, ensuring that data from wage submission
to blockchain confirmation, AI analysis, and dashboard updates occurs in near real-
time. This rapid response is essential to support dynamic monitoring and timely
decision-making by policymakers using the government dashboard.
26
Chapter 4
System Design and Schedule
The Blockchain and AI Enabled Income Traceability System is designed as a
secure, multilayered architecture that ensures fairness, transparency, and real time
accountability in welfare distribution. It follows a client–server model, where
the client side consists of mobile and web applications that act as the main
interaction point for workers, employers, and policymakers. These interfaces
allow users to submit digital wage data, verify their identity through Aadhaar or
PAN (optionally anonymized for privacy), and access income records or welfare
eligibility information.
At the heart of the system is a private blockchain network implemented in Go
and structured around Hyperledger Fabric principles. This network records every
verified wage transaction as an immutable entry in a distributed ledger. Each
transaction contains essential metadata such as payment mode, timestamp, and job
type, creating a transparent and tamper proof wage history. Smart contract logic
manages record validation, integrity checks, and controlled data sharing between
authorized entities such as government departments and NGOs.
Working alongside the blockchain is an independent AI analytics engine that
functions outside the chain. This engine analyzes blockchain verified wage data
to estimate income, detect anomalies, and classify individuals into categories
such as Below Poverty Line or Above Poverty Line using statistical and machine
learning models. The insights produced by this engine, including predicted annual
income, anomaly alerts, and dynamic eligibility scores, are delivered to a real time
27
policy dashboard that provides decision makers with a comprehensive and privacy
preserving view of income patterns and welfare distributions.
By combining blockchain based immutability with AI driven intelligence, the
system creates a transparent and adaptive digital framework for income traceability.
Its modular design supports seamless integration with India’s existing digital public
infrastructure such as UPI, Aadhaar, and eShram, paving the way for accurate
welfare targeting and a more equitable economic ecosystem.
4.1 System Architecture
The proposed system architecture is a sophisticated, multi-layered platform engi-
neered to facilitate complex interactions between workers, employers, and policy
administrators. It is built upon a modern microservices paradigm, creating a
clear separation of concerns that integrates advanced capabilities like artificial
intelligence, blockchain, and critical third-party services. This design ensures
the platform is not only robust and scalable but also secure and intelligent in its
operations. The primary entry point for all users is through a set of specialized front-
end applications: the Worker App, the Employer App, and the Policy Dashboard.
Each application is tailored to the specific needs of its user group—for instance,
workers might use their app to apply for benefits and track payments, employers
to verify employment and manage compliance, and administrators to monitor the
ecosystem’s health and enforce policies via the dashboard.
All traffic from these applications is securely managed and directed by an API
Gateway. This component serves as a unified interface to the backend, handling
crucial cross-cutting concerns such as request routing, load balancing, authentica-
tion, and rate limiting. By abstracting the backend complexity, the gateway provides
a single, secure entry point, protecting the internal services from direct exposure.
At the heart of the system lies the central App Service, which functions as the
primary orchestrator. Upon receiving a validated request from the API Gateway,
this service implements the core business logic, coordinating tasks and delegating
responsibilities to the various specialized subsystems.
28
A key feature of this architecture is its data-driven decision-making capability,
powered by the Intelligence Subsystem. This subsystem’s core is the AI Engine,
which is invoked by the App Service to perform advanced analytical tasks. These
tasks include Income Estimation to predict a worker’s income for credit or subsidy
applications; Anomaly Detection to monitor for fraud or system abuse; and
Eligibility Classification to automate the process of determining if an individual
qualifies for certain policies. The intelligence of this engine is not static; it is
continuously refined through an offline Training Phase. This represents a complete
Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline, including Data Sourcing, Data
Preparation, Model Training, Model Validation, and Model Saving, ensuring the
models are always up-to-date and accurate.
For processes that demand the highest levels of integrity and auditability, the system
leverages an On-Chain Subsystem. This private blockchain network provides a
tamper-proof distributed ledger for recording critical transactions. The App Service
communicates with the network’s Peers, which host the ledger and execute business
logic encapsulated in ChainCode (smart contracts). The network’s integrity is
maintained by an Orderer, which sequences transactions chronologically, and a
Certificate Authority (CA), which manages the digital identities of all participants
to ensure only authorized entities can access the network. To function within a real-
world context, the architecture relies on an Integration Subsystem to connect with
essential external services like the Aadhaar Service for identity verification and the
UPI Service for instant financial transactions. Finally, to ensure performance and
resilience, a Persistence Subsystem stores Snapshots of system state or frequently
accessed data, reducing latency and providing a mechanism for state recovery.
29
Figure 4.1: Architecture Diagram
4.2 Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram for the Tracient system illustrates the interaction flows
between the primary actors—the System Administrator, Employer, Worker, and
Government Authority—and the core functionalities of the platform. It defines the
specific roles and permissions each actor has within this blockchain-based income
traceability ecosystem.
For the System Administrator, the responsibilities are purely technical and foun-
dational. This actor is in charge of the initial setup and ongoing maintenance of
the system’s infrastructure. Their key actions include managing the blockchain
network, deploying and updating the AI models that perform the income analysis,
setting the initial policy rules in the system, and managing overall system access
for other users.
The Employer’s role is central to the data input process within the formal
employment flow. Their primary function is to manage their roster of workers and,
most importantly, submit digital wage payments directly into the system. Each
submission creates a verifiable, immutable transaction on the blockchain, forming
the basis of a worker’s income history.
The Worker is a primary beneficiary and user of the system with several key
interactions. They can view their complete wage history as recorded on the
30
Figure 4.2: Use Case Diagram
blockchain, check their real-time welfare eligibility status as determined by the
AI engine, and receive notifications from the system. The diagram also outlines an
”Informal Employment Flow” where a worker can generate a personal QR code,
allowing them to receive payments from various sources in a digitally traceable
manner, which is crucial for those without a single, formal employer.
Finally, the Government Authority acts as the primary consumer and overseer of
the system’s data. They can monitor aggregated, anonymized income trends and
eligibility distributions through a dedicated dashboard. They have the capability
to audit transactions to ensure transparency and accountability. Crucially, they can
also update the policy rules (e.g., income thresholds for BPL status) that the AI
engine uses for its classifications, ensuring the system remains aligned with current
government policies.
Overall, this workflow clearly defines how each actor contributes to and benefits
from the system, creating a closed-loop process for transparent wage logging,
31
intelligent income analysis, and dynamic policy management to ensure equitable
welfare distribution.
4.3 Data Flow Diagram
A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation that depicts how data
moves through a system, showing the relationship between processes, data stores,
and external entities. In the TRACIENT – Income Traceability System, the DFD
provides a clear visualization of how wage-related information is collected, verified,
processed, and analyzed across different stakeholders such as Workers, Employers,
Banking Systems, and Government Officials.
4.3.1 Level 0 Data Flow Diagram
The Level 0 Data Flow Diagram for the TRACIENT – Blockchain-Based Income
Traceability System for Equitable Welfare Distribution illustrates the system as a
single, high-level process interacting with multiple external entities. This top-level
representation highlights how data enters and leaves the system, focusing on the
major information exchanges between users, organizations, and government bodies.
The worker interacts with the system by registering and submitting personal and
income details. Their wage data is verified and stored securely on the blockchain.
The worker can also view verified income records, check their eligibility status, and
receive welfare related updates based on their verified income category.
The employer provides wage and work details of the employees. These records are
verified and uploaded into the system to ensure transparency in wage payments.
Each transaction entered by the employer is authenticated and converted into a
digital proof, preventing manipulation or false reporting of income.
The banking system plays the role of verifying the payment transactions made by
the employer. It confirms that the wages transferred to workers are genuine and
completed successfully. This verified data is then stored on the blockchain through
the TRACIENT system, ensuring all wage records are legitimate and immutable.
32
Figure 4.3: Level 0 Data Flow Diagram
The government authority accesses the verified data to analyze income patterns and
classify citizens based on income levels such as APL or BPL. The system provides
summarized reports generated using AI analysis, which help in fair and accurate
welfare distribution and policy decisions.
4.3.2 Level 1 Data Flow Diagram
The Level 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) provides the system’s highest-level
functional overview. It focuses on the entire TRACIENT system as a single, central
process (Process 1.0). This diagram clearly establishes the system’s boundaries by
identifying the three major external entities (Worker, Employer, and Government
Authority), the two key data stores (D1 and D2), and the essential data flows that
convert raw income reports into verifiable, categorized data for equitable welfare
distribution.
The Daily Wage Worker (DWW) is the first external entity, acting as the primary
source of input for the system. They send their raw income and transaction data
into the system, initiating the process of tracing their financial activity to establish
a verifiable record.
33
Figure 4.4: Level 1 Data Flow Diagram
The Employer is the second critical external entity whose role is validation. They
interact with the system to verify the accuracy of the employment and transaction
data provided by the DWW. This check is crucial for ensuring the integrity and
trustworthiness of the initial income records.
The Government Authority is the main consumer entity. This authority retrieves
the finalized data output from the system, specifically the verified and categorized
DWW financial profiles, which are then used to make informed and targeted
decisions about the allocation of welfare resources.
The entire functionality of the project is encompassed within Process 1.0: Income
Tracing and Welfare Management. This is the core engine that receives input from
both the DWW and the Employer, applies the Blockchain security layer, analyzes
the data, and transforms it into the essential financial categorization used for welfare
management.
D1 Income Records is the first data store, acting as the system’s permanent ledger.
34
It securely houses all the verified, raw transaction and income data received from
the external entities. The data here forms the immutable historical record, secured
by the underlying Blockchain technology.
D2 DWW Profile is the second data store, holding the processed and summarized
information. It contains the personal and final financial categorization of each
Daily Wage Worker, which is the direct output of Process 1.0. This is the store
the Government Authority queries to retrieve actionable welfare decision data.
4.3.3 Level 2 Data Flow Diagram
The DFD Level 2 provides the crucial expansion of the system’s core function
by performing a decomposition of the single Process 1.0 (Income Tracing and
Welfare Management). This detailed view breaks down the overall function
into specific, manageable sub-processes, revealing the internal mechanics of the
TRACIENT system. It explicitly illustrates how verified income input is securely
recorded via the blockchain, subsequently analyzed through intelligent models,
and ultimately transformed into the categorized profile data that the Government
Authority requires.
The Daily Wage Worker (DWW) entity is the origin point, sending their claimed
employment and transaction data to the system. This entity’s interaction initiates
the entire income traceability sequence, making the DWW the primary data subject
whose financial activities are being authenticated and recorded.
The Employer entity plays the role of the necessary external validator. They interact
with the system to confirm and verify the records submitted by the worker. This
cross-verification step is vital for establishing the foundational trustworthiness of
the income data before it is permanently stored or processed.
The module for Data Submission and Validation acts as the system’s intake and
scrubbing area. It receives the raw data from the DWW and the confirmation from
the Employer. Its function is to perform initial integrity checks, ensure the data is
properly formatted, and package the fully verified and clean income information.
The Blockchain Record Creation module is the security core of the system.
It receives the validated data and executes the cryptographic and consensus
35

mechanisms required to securely and immutably write the transaction record onto
the distributed ledger. This action is responsible for updating the D1 Income
Records data store, guaranteeing a tamper-proof history.
The Income Profile Analysis module represents the system’s intelligence. It
retrieves the secured transaction history from the D1 Income Records and applies
sophisticated AI/ML logic to assess transaction patterns, calculate average income,
and determine the worker’s official financial categorization (e.g., eligibility criteria).
The final module, Welfare Data Finalization and Delivery, handles the preparation
and delivery of the final output. It takes the categorized status from the analysis
module, uses it to update the strategic D2 DWW Profile data store, and manages
the secure communication link to the Government Authority for data retrieval.
D1 Income Records is the foundational, secure data store. It maintains the
complete, chronological, and cryptographically verified history of every income
transaction within the TRACIENT system. This store serves as the single source of
immutable truth for the downstream analytical modules.
D2 DWW Profile is the strategic data store, containing the summary-level informa-
tion. It holds the finalized financial status and categorization for each Daily Wage
36
Worker. This store is specifically designed to provide the Government Authority
with clean, immediate, and actionable data needed for welfare resource allocation.
The Government Authority is the recipient entity, concluding the data flow by inter-
acting with the final module to securely obtain the Verified DWW Categorization.
This final interaction confirms that the system has successfully translated raw input
into its defined goal: reliable data for equitable welfare distribution.
4.4 ER Diagram
This Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram models a system for managing worker
wages, employment history, and regulatory oversight, potentially leveraging blockchain
technology. The diagram outlines the relationships among seven key entities:
Employer, Worker, Transaction, Wage History, Policy Rule, Anomaly, and Gov-
ernment.
The core of the system revolves around the interaction between an Employer and
a Worker. An Employer, identified byemployer idand containing details such
as company name and GSTIN/PAN, can employ multiple Workers. Each Worker
is uniquely identified byworker idand has attributes includingidentity info
andUPI idfor receiving payments.
The financial exchange is captured by theTransactionentity. An Employer
can initiate multiple Transactions, each received by a Worker. Each Transaction
includes attributes such astransaction id,wage amount,payment method,
and anon chain hashto indicate that records may be stored immutably on a
blockchain. Each Transaction is recorded in theWage Historyentity, which
maintains a Worker’stotal incomeandeligibility status. The diagram
specifies a one-to-one relationship between a Worker and their Wage History.
Regulatory and compliance aspects are handled by thePolicy RuleandGovern-
mententities. Policy Rules, which define specific regulations withstart dateand
enddate, can be applied to multiple Workers, and each Worker can be subject to
multiple Policy Rules, establishing a many-to-many relationship. The Government
entity oversees multiple Wage Histories and is linked to theAnomalyentity. If a
37
Transaction is flagged for an anomaly (e.g., for security or compliance reasons), the
Government is notified, ensuring a clear channel for monitoring and fraud detection.

4.5 Gantt Chart
The overall project timeline is systematically managed using a Gantt Chart spanning
a fourteen-week period, from July to October. This chart visually represents the
project’s phased approach, ensuring that all foundational and design activities are
completed in a structured sequence before the final documentation phase begins.
The total duration allocated for the documentation and design tasks establishes a
clear schedule for the deliverables.
The initial phase of the project focused on establishing the groundwork. This
began with the crucial Topic Selection, which was completed over 10 days. This
was immediately followed by the extensive Literature Survey, which was allocated
21 days to ensure a thorough understanding of the existing research landscape,
protocols, and technologies relevant to the TRACIENT system. These tasks lay
the theoretical and informational foundation for the entire project.
38
The core system design phase was then undertaken, focusing on high-level
architectural and functional mapping. This phase started with the Architecture
Diagram (14 days) and the Usecase Diagram (7 days). This was followed by a
sequential documentation of the system’s data flow, beginning with DFD Level 0 (3
days) and progressing to the more detailed DFD Level 1 (7 days) and DFD Level 2
(7 days). Simultaneously, the logical structure of the database was finalized through
the ER Diagram (6 days), ensuring data integrity was planned early in the process.
Finally, the project shifted focus toward implementation planning and formal
documentation. The Module Division task was completed over 5 days to clearly
define the coding structure and assignment of sub-systems. The entire project then
culminated in the single longest activity: Report Generation, which spans 18 days.
This final phase includes all necessary writing, editing, reviewing, and formatting to
produce the final comprehensive project report, thereby concluding the scheduled
work breakdown structure in October.
