### **Phase 1: Foundation & Local Proof of Concept**

**Objective:** To build a fully local, functional prototype that validates the core concept.

**Completed Steps:**

1.  **Project Analysis & Planning:**
    *   Analyzed all provided documents (`Roadmap-Main_project.pdf`, `Tracient Project Roadmap.pdf`, `Details.txt`).
    *   Synthesized the information into a new, refined plan.
    *   **Deliverable:** Created and saved `detailed_roadmap_final.md`.

2.  **Environment Setup (Completed):**
    *   Created the core project directory structure: `blockchain/`, `ai-model/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`.
    *   Successfully installed Hyperledger Fabric binaries, Docker images, and sample projects.
        *   Downloaded the `install-fabric.sh` script.
        *   Troubleshooted and resolved shell execution errors.
        *   Resolved the Docker connection error by starting Docker Desktop.
        *   **Deliverable:** A complete local Hyperledger Fabric development environment.

### **Current Status & Next Steps**

*   **Current Status:** The development environment is fully set up. All necessary tools and Fabric components are installed.

*   **Immediate Next Action (When you return):**
    1.  Open a **Git Bash** terminal.
    2.  Navigate to the test network directory: `cd C:\Users\niran\Documents\Major-Project\blockchain\fabric-samples\test-network`
    3.  Run the command to start the network and create a channel: `./network.sh up createChannel`

*   **Upcoming Step (After starting the network):**
    *   Deploy and interact with a sample smart contract (chaincode) to understand the fundamentals.
