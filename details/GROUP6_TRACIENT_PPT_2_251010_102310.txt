INTRODUCTION
Our Vision: To revolutionize welfare distribution in India by establishing a
robust, transparent, and accurate income assessment system for daily
wage and informal sector workers.
Core Innovation: Leveraging the inherent security and immutability of
Blockchain technology for verifiable income records, complemented by
AI/ML for intelligent analysis.
This enables accurate financial categorization of citizens, helping
authorities design welfare schemes tailored to the specific needs of each
group.
Driving Force: Addressing the critical societal challenge of misallocated
welfare resources and ensuring benefits reach the truly deserving, fostering
social and economic equity.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
India’s informal sector struggles with inequitable welfare and unreliable
income assessments due to fragmented methods like government surveys
and banking data, resulting in false tax avoidance, inflated welfare claims,
and social inequities.
Our solution uses a private blockchain to create a verifiable digital wage
history, providing a solid foundation for accurate income data.
AI/ML models improve this by estimating income, determining dynamic
welfare eligibility (BPL/APL) and offering real-time insights via a
privacy-preserving dashboard for policymakers.
Compared to traditional methods, our system enhances accuracy,
adaptability, and fairness in welfare delivery.
Accurate income traceability ensures proper income tax calculation for
individuals, promoting fairness and accountability across the entire
workforce, not just the formal sector.

LITERATURE SURVEY
On the Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology: A
Perspective About Security
The integration of AI and Blockchain boosts security and trust by
mitigating the inherent weaknesses of each technology.
The model facilitates decentralized decision-making by processing secure,
digitally signed data directly from a blockchain.
This integrated approach is applicable in sectors like healthcare, supply
chain management, and finance.
The paper analyzes security threats for both AI (adversarial attacks, data
privacy, bias) and blockchain (51% attacks, smart contract bugs),
proposing mitigation strategies.
Disadvantages:
The framework is theoretical, lacking specific implementation details.
There are inherent trade-offs between efficiency, security, and
decentralization.
AI models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where manipulated input
data yields incorrect outputs.

LITERATURE SURVEY
Blockchain-Integrated Digital Payment Systems in the Public Sector
Explores integrating blockchain with public digital payment systems (like
UPI) in emerging markets to boost transparency, security, and efficiency.
This hybrid model improves transparency via immutable records, enhances
security by eliminating single points of failure, and increases efficiency by
cutting intermediaries and costs.
Provides actionable policy recommendations, including developing
blockchain regulations, establishing a national framework, and running
pilot projects.
Details a framework for integrating blockchain into an existing system
(UPI) to solve specific public sector challenges.
Disadvantages:
Standalone blockchains are inefficient for high-volume transactions due to
overhead and server congestion.
Integrating decentralized blockchain with a centralized system is a major
technical hurdle requiring complex APIs and middleware.

LITERATURE SURVEY
Blockchain-Based KYC and Access Verification
Traditional KYC is manual, costly, and centralized, making it inefficient
and prone to breaches.
Blockchain offers a decentralized, secure, and automated KYC using smart
contracts and cryptography.
Privacy is ensured by storing sensitive data off-chain while keeping its hash
on-chain.
Framework uses DIDs, ZKPs, and smart contracts, allowing users data
control and selective sharing.
Disadvantages:
Poor interoperability across blockchain platforms.
Regulatory issues with GDPR and AML compliance.
Limited applicability to specific use cases.

LITERATURE SURVEY
EXISTING SYSTEM
An explainable federated blockchain framework with privacy preserving AI
optimization for securing healthcare data
The PPFBXAIO framework combines Federated Learning (FL),
blockchain, and Explainable AI (XAI) to enable secure, private, and
transparent model training across institutions without centralizing raw
data.
Blockchain creates a tamper-proof audit trail for model updates, while
smart contracts are used to validate and deploy only high-quality models.
The Levy Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (LGOA) improves feature
selection, and SHAP provides interpretable outputs without exposing
sensitive data.
Experimental results show improved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
scores, with lower latency and stronger defense against adversarial attacks.

LITERATURE SURVEY
Disadvantages of the Existing System:
The framework is limited to healthcare diagnostics and lacks broader
applications in areas like wage transparency or tax fairness.
It remains largely theoretical and institution-specific, without integrating
into large-scale public infrastructures like Aadhaar or UPI.
Its models are static, designed for fixed medical conditions, and do not
adapt to dynamic human or socio-economic changes.
