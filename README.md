## 1. Core Idea

TRACIENT turns income verification from survey-based self-reporting into a verifiable digital pipeline:

1. Wage and payment events are captured as structured records.
2. Records are anchored in a tamper-resistant ledger.
3. AI models estimate income patterns, classify BPL/APL, and flag anomalies.
4. Government dashboards show eligibility and fraud-risk insights in near real time.

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional income intelligence for welfare administration struggles with:

- Incomplete and outdated datasets
- Data manipulation through self-declarations
- Weak coverage of informal workers
- Poor traceability and auditability

This causes leakage (ineligible inclusion), exclusion (eligible people left out), and weak policy outcomes.

## 3. Proposed Solution

TRACIENT uses a hybrid architecture:

- Blockchain Layer: Immutable wage/payment trail using Hyperledger Fabric
- AI/ML Layer: Classification and anomaly detection
- Application Layer: Role-based workflows for workers, employers, administrators, and government officials
- Dashboard Layer: Monitoring, policy analytics, and anomaly review

## 8. End-to-End Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as Employer / Payment Source
  participant B as Backend API
  participant DB as MongoDB
  participant BC as Hyperledger Fabric
  participant AI as AI Service
  participant G as Government Dashboard

  U->>B: Submit wage / payment record
  B->>B: Validate identity, role & schema
  B->>DB: Persist validated record
  B->>BC: Anchor record on ledger (optional)
  B->>AI: Request classification & anomaly scan
  AI-->>B: Return BPL/APL result + anomaly signals
  B->>DB: Store AI results & eligibility state
  DB-->>G: Aggregate metrics & anomaly alerts
  BC-->>G: Supply tamper-proof audit trail
```

1. Wage/payment data is submitted digitally (application APIs, QR/UPI simulation in prototype).
2. Backend validates identities, roles, and schema.
3. Data is persisted to MongoDB and optionally written to Fabric chaincode.
4. Family/worker data is evaluated by AI service for classification and anomaly signals.
5. Government dashboards aggregate metrics, anomalies, and eligibility state.

- `/api/auth`
- `/api/workers`
- `/api/wages`
- `/api/upi` and `/api/qr`
- `/api/government`
- `/api/employers`

- `/api/blockchain`
- `/api/family`
- `/api/iam`

For endpoint-level request/response examples, start with `backend/README.md` and route/controller files in `backend/routes` and `backend/controllers`.

## 14. AI Models and Services

### APL/BPL Classification

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  I[Worker / Family Profile] --> M[ML Classifier\nRandom Forest]
  M --> R[SECC-Style Rule Engine]
  R --> O{Eligibility Decision}
  O -->|BPL| B[Below Poverty Line]
  O -->|APL| A[Above Poverty Line]
```

- Service file: `ai-model/apl_bpl_model/api.py`
- Endpoint: `POST /classify`
- Includes ML output and SECC-style rule interpretation
- Backend applies additional policy screening before final classification

### Anomaly Detection

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  T[Transaction Records] --> IF[Isolation Forest\nAnomaly Model]
  IF --> S{Anomaly Score}
  S -->|High Risk| AL[Alert Generated]
  S -->|Normal| OK[Record Cleared]
```

- Endpoint: `POST /detect-anomaly`
- Batch endpoint: `POST /batch-detect-anomaly`
- Uses pattern-based signals (not fixed income thresholds)
- Backend government flows can trigger anomaly scans and generate alerts

### Fallback Behavior

If AI API is unavailable, backend services use rule-based fallback logic for classification to keep workflows functional.

## 15. Blockchain Layer

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  subgraph Fabric ["Hyperledger Fabric Network"]
    CC[Go Chaincode]
    subgraph OPS ["Ledger Operations"]
      W[Wage Records]
      ID[Identity Registry]
      PC[Poverty Status Checks]
      AN[Anomaly Records]
      CM[Compliance Logs]
    end
    CC --> OPS
  end

  subgraph Scripts ["Lifecycle Scripts"]
    SN[start-network]
    DC[deploy-chaincode]
    TC[test-chaincode]
    RN[restart-network]
    FS[fresh-start]
  end

  Scripts --> Fabric
```

Blockchain module provides:

- Fabric test network lifecycle scripts
- Go chaincode for wage records, identity, poverty checks, anomalies, and compliance
- Scripted deploy/restart/test utilities

Core scripts in `blockchain/`:

- `start-network.sh` / `start-network.ps1`
- `restart-network.sh` / `restart-network.ps1`
- `deploy-chaincode.sh` / `deploy-chaincode.ps1`
- `test-chaincode.sh` / `test-chaincode.ps1`
- `fresh-start.sh` / `fresh-start.ps1`

## 16. Testing and Validation

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Additional utility scripts exist in `backend/` for seeding and environment checks (for example, `create-test-accounts.js`, `verify-database.js`, `seed.js`).

### Blockchain

```bash
cd blockchain
./test-chaincode.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd blockchain
.\test-chaincode.ps1
```

### AI

Use module-specific scripts in `ai-model/anomaly_detection_model` and `ai-model/apl_bpl_model` for training, inference, and API checks.

## 17. Limitations and Deployment Challenges

- High system complexity across multiple runtimes (Node, Python, Go, Fabric)
- Integration burden with existing national/state systems
- Infrastructure requirements for real-time, high-volume transaction processing
- Data governance and regulatory clarity needed for production-scale rollout
- Adoption challenges for informal workers without assisted digital channels

## 18. Feasibility Notes

- Operational feasibility improves with low-friction user channels (mobile app, assisted service points, SMS/IVR support)
- Economic feasibility depends on phased implementation and fraud-reduction ROI
- Technical feasibility depends on reliable streaming/event pipelines and robust observability

## 19. Security and Privacy Notes

- Use strict secret management for JWT, DB, and service credentials
- Store only hashed/least-privilege identity data where possible
- Apply role-based access and audit logging across sensitive operations
- Enforce encryption in transit and at rest in production deployments
- Conduct regular model drift, bias, and false-positive/negative reviews

## 20. Roadmap

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  P1[Phase 1\nStabilize local\nend-to-end stack] --> P2[Phase 2\nHarden API contracts\n& auth flows]
  P2 --> P3[Phase 3\nExpand model validation\nwith real data]
  P3 --> P4[Phase 4\nProduction observability\n& SLOs]
  P4 --> P5[Phase 5\nPhased pilot deployment\nwith policy feedback]
```

1. Stabilize local end-to-end stack with reproducible environments.
2. Harden API contracts and auth/session flows.
3. Expand model validation using real anonymized transaction distributions.
4. Add production-grade observability, SLOs, and incident workflows.
5. Pilot phased deployment with bounded geography and policy feedback loops.

## 21. Conclusion

TRACIENT demonstrates how verifiable transaction trails + AI-driven analysis can modernize welfare eligibility assessment. The concept is strong and policy-relevant, while implementation is intentionally ambitious and best approached through phased deployment.
